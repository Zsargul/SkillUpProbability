# SkillUpProbability

A simple trade-skill add-on for World of Warcraft: TBC Classic which displays the percentage chance of a skill-up beside your craftable items list in your 
trade-skill window, like so:

Gray items don't display anything at all, since they are always 0%.

## Download
From [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/skillupprobability) or you can just download a ```.zip``` of this repo and unzip it in your game's addons folder.

## About
The calculations are based off of [the following formula](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Profession#Increasing_professional_skill_level) from the game's wiki. 
Contrary to what many think, the chances are not as simple as green, yellow and orange being 25%, 75% and 100% respectively. This add-on simply shows you the
true probability of gaining a skill-up when crafting an item, displaying them beside each item's name in your trade-skill window. In other words, you can 
now see why you crafted 30 green items in a row and still didn't hit a skill-up :P.
